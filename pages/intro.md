# Introduction
### Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this Instruction Manual is to provide Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Program and Project Managers (PM) with guidance to support the implementation of Agile
Information Technology (IT) development as outlined by DHS MD/Instruction 102-01-004 Agile
Development and Delivery for Information Technology. Although Agile practices are expanding into
other areas, this Instruction Manual focuses on software development. It helps PMs build upon
best practices and experience from industry, federal government, and recent DHS implementations
of Agile methodologies. This guidance is intended to enhance understanding of why Agile is the preferred approach to federal IT development, and to provide a starting point for increasing DHS-wide application of and expertise in Agile methodologies. This Instruction Manual is intended to help PMs and other key stakeholders understand how Agile IT development satisfies the
requirements of the Systems Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) (as established by [DHS MD 102-01-103](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Instruction_102-01-004_Revision_00_Agile_Development_SIGNED_04-11-2016%281%29.pdf))
to support individual IT project needs, while meeting the intent of the [25 Point Implementation Plan
to Reform Federal Information Technology Management](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/digital-strategy/25-point-implementation-plan-to-reform-federal-it.pdf), [Contracting Guidance to Support Modular
Development](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/guidance/modular-approaches-for-information-technology.pdf), and other federal guidance on improving IT development and acquisition.

To mitigate some of the challenges associated with delivering usable IT capabilities in a timely
manner, the Agile Development and Delivery Instruction identifies Agile as the preferred approach
for all IT programs and projects, when appropriate. This conforms to the practice of delivering
finalized working software to users in discrete increments within shortened time frames of six
months or less for ongoing projects and six to 12 months for initial delivery of new projects. Hence,
this guidance is consistent with the concept of modular development as outlined in the 25 Point
Implementation Plan and the Digital Services Playbook, which place a relatively short “time box”
around a project or project segment in which to plan, design, develop, test, and implement a
capability.

As this is a Instruction Manual and not an encyclopedia, it avoids highly detailed instruction and
instead presents a practical overview of Agile development methodologies and tools. It also gives
the reader directions for applying Agile techniques without dictating a specific “DHS way” for Agile.
The state of the art for applying Agile to improve IT development and delivery continues to evolve,
as do techniques and guidance for adapting Agile methodologies to the federal enterprise. This
document provides an introduction to Agile concepts, techniques, and experiences intended to help DHS PMs identify and craft program and project management options for applying Agile to achieve
greater IT development success. It is based on current best practices, but will continue to evolve as
practices change. Appendices in the back of this Instruction Manual , as well as references
throughout, provide a more detailed and focused background of proven and emerging Agile
practices. They include several resources for learning more about each.

This Instruction Manual complements the DHS Systems Engineering Lifecycle (SELC) Instruction
Guidebook ([MD 102-01-103-01](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Systems%20Engineering%20Life%20Cycle.pdf)) by working within its high-level framework without superseding
existing federal guidance. Accordingly, this Instruction Manual assists PMs in making informed
decisions about applying Agile approaches and tools within the context of DHS acquisition
management policies to improve planning efficiency, reduce overall risk, and enable rapid delivery
of useful capability. The DHS SELC is the common systems engineering framework used to guide
DHS programs and projects in the application of solid systems-engineering discipline. The SELC
provides significant detail on systems engineering and its application and execution. Agile is one
approach that encompasses the SELC’s flexible framework and can be leveraged as appropriate as
part of a DHS acquisition approach. The [SELC Tailoring Examples for Selected Types of DHS
Acquisition Programs](SELC Tailoring Examples for Selected Types of DHS Acquisition Programs) provides an example of how an Agile IT program could tailor its systems
engineering approach (and how it differs from traditional practices) to more effectively encompass
user requirements and produce a product in an Agile manner. Readers should refer to the DHS
SELC Instruction Manual or one of its supplemental guides for any systems engineering topic not
expressly covered in the DHS Agile Development Instruction Manual.

### Why Agile?

Agile development emphasizes inspecting and adapting, rather than following a plan. Teams deliver
functionality incrementally, by releasing small system increments or updates frequently, rather
than relying on a single, massive deployment. The Agile approach enables programs to deliver
prioritized capabilities to users more quickly. This approach also provides more flexibility than
many traditional methods, reducing risk by encouraging changing requirements, maximizing
learning, and providing the ability to exploit technology advances in a timely fashion. Agile
methodologies achieve this flexibility through iterative, incremental development practices that
rely on self-organizing, cross-functional teams of developers, stakeholders, and users. The
consistent interaction and partnering of individuals with different perspectives encourages
development that is highly flexible and lower risk due to frequent planning, development, and
delivery checkpoints. The Agile approach to software development incorporates an inherent
cultural change in the way professionals develop and deliver software products by integrating
users, testers, and developers and enabling them to directly address challenges together. Properly
applied, Agile techniques help teams to develop software more efficiently and effectively, providing
better solutions to their customers and stakeholders.

Agile development offers the following benefits:

* Requirements and products move at a rapid pace to
realistically accommodate technical advances
* Iterations and requirements are informed by
discovery as challenges are resolved
* Solutions are produced in a series of smaller
increments to reduce risk and meet evolving needs
* PMs select and apply the specific Agile methodologies
that best suit the needs of the program, team,
customer, and environment

DHS is working on a number of initiatives to promote
Agile/modular development in accordance with the
referenced Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
direction. These include an Agile instruction, this Instruction
Manual , and the SELC Guidance.5 An Agile Center of
Excellence and Integrated Product Team are leading these
efforts.

An Agile approach provides benefits to minimize risks and
increases the probability of acceptable delivery compared to
more traditional development processes. Agile development
allows for increased flexibility across the life cycle of a
project, though it notably does not allow PMs to begin
projects without adequate initial project planning. It is
important to acknowledge that Agile development projects
require appropriate planning both up-front and throughout
the project life cycle, so long as the planning does not
significantly delay the start of the actual execution.
This Instruction Manual provides information on how to
achieve success by implementing Agile techniques for software development at DHS.

### Document Structure
This document is configured both as a basic guide and a reference. It is structured to provide a
basic understanding of Agile up-front, with more advanced and detailed reference information
organized in the appendices:

* Section 2 provides a brief overview of Agile approaches, along with a brief discussion of the
range of Agile methodologies and tools, team roles, and project success factors
* Section 3 provides information on considerations and options for applying Agile within the
context of the established DHS acquisition and systems engineering life cycle frameworks
* Section 4 provides guidance and recommendations on developing Agile projects at DHS,
along with lessons learned from experienced PMs within Agile projects
* Section 5 outlines tips and practical lessons for implementing Agile development projects
based on DHS experience with Agile to date.

Readers who are more familiar/experienced in Agile may find the information beginning in Section
3 of particular value, as the latter sections focus on how to implement Agile specifically within DHS.
Appendices address Agile methodologies commonly used within DHS, tools that can be used to
manage Agile projects, and how PMs can generate Agile metrics and reports to support their
projects. A brief glossary of common Agile terms is provided in Appendix E. A checklist, providing
a top-level set of actions to help PMs shape their Agile approach, is included as Appendix G.

recommendations, and related questions to the Office of Program Accountbility and Risk
Management.
