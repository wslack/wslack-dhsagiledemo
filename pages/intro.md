# Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

![United States seal]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/us_seal.png "United States seal")

The purpose of this Instruction Manual is to provide Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Program and Project Managers (PM) with guidance to support the implementation of Agile
Information Technology (IT) development as outlined by DHS MD/Instruction 102-01-004 Agile
Development and Delivery for Information Technology.1 Although Agile practices are expanding into
other areas, this Instruction Manual focuses on software development. It helps PMs build upon
best practices and experience from industry, federal government, and recent DHS implementations
of Agile methodologies. This guidance is intended to enhance understanding of why Agile is the

preferred approach to federal IT development, and to provide a starting point for increasing DHS-
wide application of and expertise in Agile methodologies. This Instruction Manual is intended to

help PMs and other key stakeholders understand how Agile IT development satisfies the
requirements of the Systems Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) (as established by DHS MD 102-01-103)
to support individual IT project needs, while meeting the intent of the 25 Point Implementation Plan
to Reform Federal Information Technology Management,2 Contracting Guidance to Support Modular
Development,3 and other federal guidance on improving IT development and acquisition.
To mitigate some of the challenges associated with delivering usable IT capabilities in a timely
manner, the Agile Development and Delivery Instruction identifies Agile as the preferred approach
for all IT programs and projects, when appropriate. This conforms to the practice of delivering
finalized working software to users in discrete increments within shortened time frames of six
months or less for ongoing projects and six to 12 months for initial delivery of new projects. Hence,
this guidance is consistent with the concept of modular development as outlined in the 25 Point
Implementation Plan and the Digital Services Playbook, which place a relatively short “time box”
around a project or project segment in which to plan, design, develop, test, and implement a
capability.
As this is a Instruction Manual and not an encyclopedia, it avoids highly detailed instruction and
instead presents a practical overview of Agile development methodologies and tools. It also gives
the reader directions for applying Agile techniques without dictating a specific “DHS way” for Agile.
The state of the art for applying Agile to improve IT development and delivery continues to evolve,
as do techniques and guidance for adapting Agile methodologies to the federal enterprise. This
document provides an introduction to Agile concepts, techniques, and experiences intended to help
